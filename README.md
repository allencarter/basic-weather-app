# Basic JavaScript Weather App
A basic JavaScript weather application I built for training purposes. Uploading this app to my github in order to demonstrate my JavaScript skills. Anyone can download this and use it.

You can get your free api key from openweathermap.org. Simply signup to get your free api key.

Please note: My apiKey can be used I do not care. However the apiKey variable is made public. For security reasons I advise you store your api key in a database and then use JavaScript to get the api key from your database to allow the option of JavaScript encryptions.
